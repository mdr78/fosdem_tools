Hi {},

Please find below the FOSDEM {} Network Devroom Call For Proposals (CFP), we
would love to see a submission from you this year. Also we would appreciate your
helping us to get the word out by forwarding this CFP to any person or forum you
think may be interested in FOSDEM.

FOSDEM has zero marketing budget, so we depend entirely on volunteers and our
friends in open source spreading the word. If you are not interested in future
updates about FOSDEM, please reply to this email and I will remove you from the
distribution list.

Thanks,

Ray Kinsella
